Iâ€™m Feena Hassan, currently studying psychology with a focus on behavioral research. I specialize in literature reviews and data analysis using SPSS, and I'm passionate about exploring human behavior and motivation.

I'm actively seeking **remote research assistant opportunities** to support impactful psychological research. This site is a collection of my academic work and growing portfolio.

Feel free to explore my [publications](/publication/) or [contact me](fhassann09@gmail.com).
