abstract: "Susan B. Anthony's battle for women's rights was largely influenced by her exceptional father who became a symbol of an anchor throughout her battles. Additionally, her religious faith and social influences played a part in shaping her moral values and advocacies. Using Freud’s concepts of personality development, Erikson’s psychosocial stages, Adler’s concepts of social interest and finalism, and John B. Watson's theory of behaviorism we were able to form a deep analysis into Susan’s unique personality. From her profound passion to her courageous activism, Susan B. Anthony inspired many young advocates worldwide. Her persistent stance and never wavering courage piqued the interest of many seeking to explore the person she was brought to be. Through her enduring legacy, Susan B. Anthony not only reshaped the course of history but also set an unbreakable foundation for future generations to continue the fight for equality and justice."
